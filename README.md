# 🔐 Aeon ID

Aeon ID is a new generation identity architecture designed from the ground up.  
It introduces a modern security model based on local cryptography, secure flows and modular authentication layers — without relying on traditional password-based or legacy systems.

## 🌐 Core Principles

### ✔ New Identity Model  
A redesigned identity flow built for clarity, security and long-term reliability.

### ✔ Local Cryptographic Engine  
Devices generate and store their own secure material, enabling signed actions, offline identity and client-side trust.

### ✔ Adaptive Authentication Layers  
Multiple access modes (device, local signature, secure tokens, email links, future advanced protocols) implemented inside a unified architecture.

### ✔ Client-Side Security  
Critical material is protected before it reaches any backend, enforcing a privacy-by-design approach.

### ✔ Modular and Future-Proof  
Aeon ID integrates seamlessly with ERP systems, cloud environments and upcoming Aeon infrastructure.
